# The Go Goans

The Goans are built on the ideas of Jim Weirich and co, who produced the (Ruby Koans)[https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans].

## Dependencies

The Goans are built on top of (GoConvey)[http://goconvey.co/]

## Work in Progress!
At this stage the Goans are very much a work in progress.  I'll be pushing changes regularly as I build the project.

## Contributing

Pull request and suggestions are welcome.

My rules are simple, this is a project of good will, given freely.  If you want to give feedback, contribute or just ask for additions, first BE NICE!

I'm sure there will be areas where I get things wrong and welcome feedback.  That's how I learn and I encourage it, but please guide rather than chastise.
